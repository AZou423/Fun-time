Ooooh don't we look good together?
Theres a reason why they watch all night long
Yeah know we'll turn heads forever
So tonight I'm gonna show you off
When I'm walking with you
I watch the whole world change
Cause baby that's what you do
No baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Blame it on your measurements
Shut that sh*t on sight
Thats right
We out here dripping in finnesse 
It don't make no sense
And now we dripping in finnesse
You know it, you know it
